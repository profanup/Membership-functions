# This repository contains implementation of various fuzzy membership functions 

Membership functions for fuzzy logic, encoded and plotted in python.

The following membership functions showed are:
- Pending function
- Linear function
- Triangular function
- Trapezoidal function
- Generalized bell function
- Gaussian function

# How to use code

You can clone repository on your machine. This will get you following two functions:

- membershipFunctions.py  Contains the encoding of various Fuzzy Member Ship functions. 
- graphics.py             Contains the python code to plot the membership functions  


# Prerequisite for execution 

- You require scikit-fuzzy package to be installed on local python environment
- Coomand line to do this is  : $pip3 install -U scikit-fuzzy

# How to run

- Once you satisfy the resuirement just execute graphics.py to get plots of various membershipFunctions diplayed in grid like plot
